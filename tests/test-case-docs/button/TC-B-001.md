# Test Case: TC-B-001 - Button Component Rendering and Interaction

## Test Purpose

To verify that the Button component can correctly render various button styles and respond to interaction states (hover and pressed) in the GUIDS2HTML converter.

## Test Environment

- GUIDS2HTML converter version: 1.0.0
- Supported browsers: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

## Preconditions

1. GUIDS2HTML converter is installed and configured correctly
2. Test case JSON file (TC-B-001.json) is available in the tests/data/components/button directory

## Test Steps

1. Load the TC-B-001.json test file
2. Convert the GUIDS description to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the GUIDS2HTML converter
3. Open the generated HTML file in a supported browser
4. Observe the rendering of each button type
5. Hover over each button to verify hover state styles
6. Click on each button to verify pressed state styles and click event handling

## Test Data

The test case utilizes a JSON file containing various button types:

- Basic Button: A simple button with default styling
- Primary Button: Primary-styled button with blue background
- Secondary Button: Secondary-styled button with gray background
- Rounded Button: Button with increased corner radius
- Icon Button: Button containing an icon
- Large Button: Button with increased dimensions
- Small Button: Button with decreased dimensions
- Disabled Button: Non-interactive button with disabled styling
- Shadow Button: Button with drop shadow effect
- Success Button: Green-styled button for success actions
- Danger Button: Red-styled button for destructive actions
- Gradient Button: Button with gradient background

## Expected Results

1. All buttons are rendered with correct dimensions, positioning, background colors, and text content
2. When hovering over buttons (except disabled), hover state styles are applied correctly:
   - Background color changes according to the hover state definition
   - Scale transformation is applied if defined
3. When pressing buttons (except disabled), pressed state styles are applied correctly:
   - Background color darkens according to the pressed state definition
   - Scale transformation is applied if defined
4. When clicking buttons, the associated click action is executed correctly
5. Disabled button remains visually distinct and does not respond to hover or click interactions
6. All buttons maintain proper text alignment and padding

## Verification Points

1. **Visual Rendering**: Proper rendering of all button types with correct styles
2. **Hover State**: Correct application of hover styles when mouse is over buttons
3. **Pressed State**: Correct application of pressed styles when buttons are clicked
4. **Interaction Handling**: Execution of click handlers when buttons are activated
5. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic structure for accessibility (role, tabindex, etc.)
6. **Responsiveness**: Buttons adapt appropriately to container sizes

## Actual Results

## Remarks

The Button component is a fundamental UI element that requires precise rendering and interaction behavior. This test case ensures that buttons not only display correctly but also respond appropriately to user interactions, maintaining consistent visual feedback across different states.
