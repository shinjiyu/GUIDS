# TC-I-001 - Image Component Rendering Test

## Test Purpose

To verify that the Image component can correctly render images with various styling options and functionality according to the GUIDS specification, including basic rendering, rounded corners, circular shapes, different resize modes, borders, and interactive behaviors.

## Test Environment

- GUIDS2HTML Converter v1.0 or higher
- Supported browsers:
  - Chrome 90+
  - Firefox 88+
  - Safari 14+
  - Edge 90+

## Preconditions

1. The GUIDS2HTML converter is properly installed and configured.
2. The test case JSON file is available at `tests/data/components/image/TC-I-001.json`.
3. The image assets referenced in the test case are available in the `assets/images/` directory:
   - sample1.jpg
   - sample2.jpg
   - sample3.jpg
   - sample4.jpg
   - sample_avatar.jpg
   - sample_landscape.jpg
   - sample_portrait.jpg

## Test Steps

1. Load the test case JSON file from `tests/data/components/image/TC-I-001.json`.
2. Execute the GUIDS2HTML converter with the following command:
   ```
   node src/index.js convert tests/data/components/image/TC-I-001.json -o output/tc-i-001.html
   ```
3. Verify the conversion process completes without errors.
4. Open the generated HTML file in each supported browser.
5. Observe the rendering of each image component in the test case.
6. Test interactive behaviors by hovering over and clicking on the interactive image.

## Expected Results

1. **Basic Image**:

   - The image should render correctly within the specified dimensions.
   - The background color should be visible if the image has transparent areas.
   - The image should maintain its original aspect ratio within the bounds.

2. **Rounded Image**:

   - The image should display with 20px rounded corners on all four sides.
   - The image content should be clipped at the rounded edges.

3. **Circle Image**:

   - The image should display as a perfect circle with 50px corner radius.
   - The circular clipping should be smooth and consistent around the edges.
   - The image content should be centered and proportional within the circle.

4. **Cover Mode Image**:

   - The image should fill the entire container while maintaining its aspect ratio.
   - Parts of the image may be cropped to ensure the container is completely filled.
   - The image should be centered within the container.

5. **Contain Mode Image**:

   - The entire image should be visible within the container while maintaining its aspect ratio.
   - There may be empty space (showing the background color) on the sides or top/bottom.
   - The image should be centered within the container.

6. **Interactive Image**:

   - When hovered, the image should decrease in opacity to 0.8 and scale up by 5%.
   - When clicked, an alert dialog should appear with the message "Image clicked!".
   - The transition between normal and hover states should be smooth.

7. **Bordered Image**:
   - The image should display with a 4px blue (#3388cc) border.
   - The border should follow the 8px rounded corners of the image.
   - The border should be consistent in width around all sides of the image.
